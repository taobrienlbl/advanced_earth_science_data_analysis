# COMPLETE | Homework 08a

**Goal:** get set up with IU supercomputing accounts in advance of our labs and assignments on parallel programming.

**Caution:** Follow all instructions carefully.  Your grade for this assignment will be reduced if instructions are not followed.

## Account and VS Code Setup
1. Create UITS accounts for the following (see [this link](https://kb.iu.edu/d/achr)):
    * Big Red 200
    * Quartz
    * Slate
    * Slate-Project
1. (optional $^*$) Set up passwordless login:
    * https://kb.iu.edu/d/aews
    * ["SSH public key authentication to HPS systems" agreement](https://hpceverywhere.iu.edu/forms/agree?_gl=1*cxl9lp*_ga*MTI1NDQ3ODYxNi4xNjk2OTY2NzM1*_ga_61CH0D2DQW*MTY5NzQ3MDc4OC4zLjEuMTY5NzQ3MTU3NC41OS4wLjA.)
1. Set up `bigred200.uits.iu.edu` in Visual Stuio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh

$^*$ passwordless login is highly recommended. If you choose not to follow this step, you will have to enter your IU password *many* times on each day that we use UITS supercomputing systems.

## Setting up your git environment
1. Connect to `bigred200.uits.iu.edu` with Visual Stuio code.
1. Clone your course repository into `/N/slate/YOURUSERNAME` (replace `YOURUSERNAME` with your UITS username)

1. Open [a terminal in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics)
    * Type the following command in the terminal and hit the *Enter* key: `pwd`
    * copy what is output, and send the result to Travis in slack

## Setting up a conda environment

(all commands that `appear like this` are intended to be typed into the terminal, followed by the *Enter* key)

1. Make a Downloads directory: `mkdir -p ~/Downloads` (the `~` symbol is short hand for `/home/YOURUSERNAME`)
1. Go to your Downloads directory: `pushd ~/Downloads`
1. Download micromamba: `wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh`
1. Run the micromamba install: `bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh`

    * Right after it asks you to accept the license terms, it will ask where to install
    * DO NOT install to the default location
    * Instead, install to `/N/slate/YOURUSERNAME/software/bigred200/miniforge3`
    * see this gif for the complete install (note the install was done on quartz, not bigred200, but the steps are identical execpt for the install directory name)

1. Open a new terminal (or just the command `bash`)
1. Prevent miniconda from automatically activating: `conda config --set auto_activate_base false`
1. Activate your environment `mamba activate`
1. Create a new easg690 environment: `mamba create -n easg690 python=3.11 --yes` (note we are using python 3.11 for this exercise)
1. Activate your new environment: `mamba activate easg690`
1. Download the class `requirements.yml` file: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taobrienlbl/advanced_earth_science_data_analysis/spring_2023_iub/lessons/06_advanced_plotting/requirements.yml`
1. Install the base packages: `mamba env update -f requirements.yml`
1. Install the jupyter kernel into the environment: `ipython kernel install --name easg690 --user`
1. Install `mpi4py` using the system MPI library: `MPICC="cc -shared" python3 -m pip install --force --no-binary=mpi4py mpi4py`

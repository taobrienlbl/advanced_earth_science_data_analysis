# Machine Learning Introduction

*Lecture number:* 07

*Target Date:* 10/06/2023

*Length:* 125 mins

## READ | Lecture Objectives:

* Describe machine learning in terms of regression
* Relate *backpropagation* and *loss* to optimization
* Implement a basic ML model with `pytorch`

### Relation to course goals:

This works toward the course goal to "apply machine learning libraries to real data."

## COMPLETE | Reading and Homework:

* Homework 07: apply machine learning concepts from today to your own research data
* Final project proposal

## PREVIEW | Class Overview:

# Parallelization Continued

*Lecture number:* 10

*Target Date:* 11/03/2023

*Length:* 150 mins

## READ | Lecture Objectives:

* Implement and run a rudimentary `mpi4py` code on BigRed200
* Implement and run advanced `mpi4py` code on BigRed200
* Install and use `simplempi`

### Relation to course goals:

This works towards the goal to "parallelize *embarrassingly parallel* data processing tasks."

## COMPLETE | Reading and Homework:

* Work on final project

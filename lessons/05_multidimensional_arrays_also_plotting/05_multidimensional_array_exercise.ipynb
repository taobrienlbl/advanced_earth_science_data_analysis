    "# Multidimensional Array Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will apply the principles of using multidimensional arrays to estimate global mean temperature from a gridded dataset, accounting for the fact that grid cells become smaller at the poles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a dataset with evenly spaced latitude and longitude values, the meridians converge at the poles, making the cells smaller.  The area of the cells is proportional to the cosine of the latitude $\\theta$ (in radians):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta A = R_{\\oplus}^2 \\Delta \\theta \\Delta \\phi \\cdot \\cos(\\theta) $$\n",
    "$$ \\Delta A \\propto \\cos(\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when calculating the global average of a quantity (like temperature), the values need to be weighted by $\\cos(\\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: correctly calculate a timeseries of global mean temperature from the dataset below\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. execute the cell below to download the dataset (this is the one we used to make sound in the first class)\n",
    "1. the cell includes code to extract the latitude values (in degrees; `lat`) and the temperature field `temp_3d` as numpy arrays\n",
    "1. calculate and plot a timeseries of global mean temperature, using the $cos(\\theta)$ weighting"

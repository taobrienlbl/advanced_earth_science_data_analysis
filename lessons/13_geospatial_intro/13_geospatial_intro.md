# Introduction to Geospatial Analysis

*Lecture number:* 13

*Target Date:* 11/28/2023 (pre-recorded)

*Length:* 75 mins

## READ | Lecture Objectives:

* Load shapefiles and spatial data with geopandas and shapely
* Perform basic geospatial tasks like reprojecting and point-in-polygon
* Plot geospatial data

### Relation to course goals:

This builds on the course goal to implement basic data analysis tasks in python (it goes a bit beyond even!).

## COMPLETE | Reading and Homework:

* See the [Customize Raster Plots](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/scientists-guide-to-plotting-data-in-python/plot-spatial-data/customize-raster-plots/plotting-extents/)  lesson from [Earth Lab](https://www.earthdatascience.org/)

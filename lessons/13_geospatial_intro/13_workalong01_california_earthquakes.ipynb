    "\n",
    "This workalong uses `geopandas` to find earthquakes within California.  It builds from the [lesson 05 warmup](https://github.com/taobrienlbl/advanced_earth_science_data_analysis/blob/8fdbb61bc39b64244f420d446b985a4d27f80df6/lessons/05_multidimensional_arrays_also_plotting/05_warmup_SOLUTION.ipynb), in which we used pandas to find earthquakes from a USGS dataset.  We'll use a similar approach to initially load the same dataset."

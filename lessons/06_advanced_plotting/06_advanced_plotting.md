# Advanced Plotting

*Lecture number:* 06

*Target Date:* 09/29/2023

*Length:* 150 mins

## READ | Lecture Objectives:

* manage multiple conda environments using `mamba`
* generate concise, readable multipanel plots
* plot map-based data

### Relation to course goals:

This lesson contributes directly toward the course goal
* generate informative publication-quality plots

There is also a somewhat tangential goal of managing python environments: not exactly a data analysis skill but critical for being able to use python.
